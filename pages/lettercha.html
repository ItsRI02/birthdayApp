            <h1>🍓Happy Birthday strawberry🍓</h1>
            <p>
                To the one who was and still the most beautiful soul I’ve ever known👻<br>
                On this day, someone truly special was born😇<br>
                A strawberry full of light, kindness, and a heart that touched mine in ways I never thought possible<br>
                Happy Birthday to you🥳<br>
                Even if we no longer share our days like we used to, your presence still lingers gently in the corners of my heart<br>
<br>
                I haven’t forgotten a single thing <br>
                Not the laughter, not the walks, not the long talks,<br>
                Not even the quiet moments we used to share in silence.<br>
<br>
                Today, I don’t just celebrate your birth<br>
                I celebrate the impact you had on my life<br>
                The lessons you taught me<br>
                And the love you gave me, even when I didn’t always deserve it<br>
<br>
                I know I made mistakes.<br>
                I know I left when I should have stayed<br>
                But every step away from you only showed me how deeply I care <br>
                And how much I want to be the man you always believed I could be<br>

                So this is not just a birthday message<br>
                It’s a promise<br>
                A promise to grow<br>
                To become better<br>
                To prepare myself for the day I can meet you again<br>
                Not as a friend but as a man ready to ask for your hand<br>

                Happy Birthday to the one I still hold in my heart<br>  
                May this year bring you peace, joy, and everything your beautiful heart desires<br>  
                And if destiny allows, may I one day celebrate this day beside you not from a freaking web site 😂😂<br>

                With all my heart❤️<br>  
                From someone who never stopped loving you❤️🌍<br>
            </p>
